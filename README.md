Unit 2 | Homework Assignment: Automate Your Day Job with Python

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `python-homework`. Then, clone it to your computer.

2. In your local git repository, create a directory for both of the Python activities. Use folder names that correspond to the activities: **PyBank** and **PyRamen**.

3. In each folder you just created, add a new file called `main.ipynb`. Remember that to create this file you will need to use JupyterLab to correctly generate the .ipynb file format. This will be the main notebook to run for each analysis.

4. Push the above changes to GitHub.
